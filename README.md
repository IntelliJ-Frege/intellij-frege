# IntelliJ IDEA plugin for Frege language

## Attention
The plugin is under development and is unstable. According to our estimates, the first stable version with the declared features will be available not earlier than 2-3 months (end of July).

## What is Frege

Frege is a Haskell for the JVM. It is functional, has strong static type system and lazy evaluations, 
but Frege compiles to Java and runs on JVM. Also, it can use any Java library and can be used inside any Java project.
